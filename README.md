# Assembler-with-python

A simple assembler that reads instructions from `assembly.txt`, processes them, and writes the symbol table and machine code to `output.txt`. 

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 (or above) installed.
3. Ensure your assembly instructions are placed in `assembly.txt`.
4. Run the assembler with:
   ```bash
   python assembler.py

### The Assembler Will

- Parse the assembly instructions.
- Generate a symbol table.
- Create machine code in binary.
- Write the results to `output.txt`.

### Files

- **assembler.py**  
  Contains the Python code for the assembler.
- **assembly.txt**  
  Example assembly instructions.
- **output.txt**  
  Created after running the assembler. Holds the symbol table and machine code.

Happy assembling!
